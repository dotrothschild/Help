    <h3>Visiting Virginia Historical Highway Markers</h3>
    <li>Is this legal?</li>
    Many sites have controlled  access. Some are on private property others require an entrance fee.
    In EVERY CASE, it is prohibited to take anything from the site.
    <li>What if the marker is offensive?</li>
    DHR’s purpose in erecting markers is to educate the public about Virginia’s history, not to
    honor, memorialize, or commemorate persons, events, or places. Because highway markers are not
    honorific in nature, they do not serve the same purpose as monuments, statues, memorial
    plaques, or war memorials.
    <p>
    Removal of historical highway markers, which are property of the commonwealth, must be
    approved in advance by the Virginia Board of Historic Resources. Unauthorized removal or
    causing damage to historical highway markers is a Class 6 felony per the Code of
    Virginia § 18.2-137.
