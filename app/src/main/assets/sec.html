    and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal
    information, in&nbsp;and other countries.</p>
<p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily

    will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal

    <li><strong> CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></li>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
    Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not
    to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
    At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
    been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
    mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
    tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
    we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.&nbsp;</p>
